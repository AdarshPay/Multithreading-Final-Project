We have a singularity container which has CUDA, Julia, Python, PyTorch, etc.
It's in a .sif file called taccjulia.sif



====== BRINGING UP THE CONTAINER ======
IDEA: 
Entering the container in a shell. Binding our github repo directory to the container!
	$ apptainer shell --nv --bind (host_path):(container_path) (singularity file)

DO:
1. $ cdw or cd $WORK

2. Download the tgz and unzip it into your working directory and into your repo's directory.

3. Your working directory should be $WORK/Multithreading-Final-Project

4. Unzip the tgz file so you just have taccjulia.sif

5. $ idev -p rtx

5. $ apptainer shell --nv --bind $WORK/Multithreaded-Final-Project:/workspace taccjulia.sif
=======================================


====== OTHER COMMANDS ======

apptainer exec --nv myjulia.sif (a command like julia, nvidia-smi, python3  -c "import torchl print(torch.cuda.is_available())")
